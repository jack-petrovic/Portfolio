<h2> üöÄ TypeScript + Vite + PostgreSQL Template </h2><br/>
Welcome to the TypeScript + Vite + PostgreSQL template! This minimal setup is designed to help you kickstart your project with TypeScript and Vite for frontend development, paired with PostgreSQL for robust data management.

<h3> üåü Introduction </h3>
This template combines the power of TypeScript, Vite, and PostgreSQL to create dynamic and efficient web applications.

- **TypeScript** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making your code more robust and easier to maintain.
- **Vite** is a modern build tool that provides fast development and optimized production builds, leveraging native ES modules.
- **PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability and performance.

For more details, check out the official documentation:
- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)

<h3> ‚öôÔ∏è Project Features </h3>
- **TypeScript Support**: Enjoy the benefits of static typing for better development experience and fewer runtime errors.<br/>
- **Fast Development with Vite**: Experience lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.<br/>
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Easily connect and interact with a PostgreSQL database for your application's data needs.<br/>

## üì¶ How to Install and Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Make sure these are installed first:
- **Node.js** (version 20 or later)
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Git**

### Clone and Set Up Steps
1. **Clone the repository** (create a new directory and clone into it):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jack-petrovic/Typescript-PostSQL.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your database:**<br/>
   **Create a .env file with your PostgreSQL connection details:<br/>
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]
   ```
   **Like this:<br/>
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgre:jack1107@localhost:5432/portfolio_db
   ```
   **Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   npm install pg @types/pg dotenv drizzle-orm drizzle-kit
   ```
   **Create the Database in PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;
   ```
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will start at http://localhost:5000.
